AdafruitMCP23008
================

A library to drive an MCP23008 integrated circuit

Installation in the Arduino environment (Unix)
=======================================

Create a symbolic link to the top directory of this library to the `libraries` directory of your Arduino Sketchbook directory. For example:

    ln -s <path to>/Adafruit-MCP23008-library/ <Arduino Sketchbook>/libraries/Adafruit-MCP23008

To work with the test program, create a symbolic link from the included test sketch into your Arduino Sketchbook directory. For example:

    ln -s <path to>/Adafruit-MCP23008-library/MCP23008_test <Arduino Sketchbook>/MCP23008_test

See the contents of the test directory for wiring details
